                                                        At WADEAWHILE, our mission is simple yet exciting: we're dedicated to crafting fun, functional, and sometimes even educational applications, primarily tailored for your mobile devices.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Our story begins with apps like 'Construct-A-Word' and 'Word Match,' which were designed with a focus on helping learners of all ages recognise and engage with words through clever matching and clue-based exercises.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But then, the plot thickened! With the advent of the AppleTV appStore, 'Word Match' underwent a grand transformation, becoming the very first native AppleTV (TvOS) application birthed by WADEAWHILE.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        This shift towards AppleTV ignited a new spark, leading us to venture into different realms. Enter 'Animal Catch,' a whimsical adventure where you control a character on a mission to catch falling cats and dogs while avoiding tricky hazards like snakes and spiders. It was so much fun that we decided to share it with iPhone, iPad, and iPod users too!

                                                        Put simply, this application was developed with the focus on the new AppleTV which introduced the AppleTV appStore and it's new controller.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The aim was to have a simple character who would be controlled by tilting the new controller from side to side and jump when the touchpad was clicked. Fortunately this controller type was also present in current Apple products like iPhone, iPad and iPod allowing for Animal Catch to be release for those products also.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Russell is the name of this character and his job is to catch as many falling Dogs and Cats as he can whilst dodging the falling Spiders and Snakes. If Russell can catch the timer that comes across the screen fro time to time, a slow motion mode will occur making all of the animals that fall after the collection to be very slow for a time period.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        At set score points you will level up which will increase the fall speed of the animals making in more and more important to catch the timer to assist in your attempt to beat the current high score whether it be held by yourself, family member or a friend.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        This is an endless play application which allows you to continue to play for as long as you can keep Russell alive. He like us has only one life and is extremely vunerable to Spider and Snake bites so please take care out there.

                                                        A bit of a difference on this application to the other as it was only developed for iPad as the smaller screens of iPhone and iPod were not suitable to display or play this application.
                                                    </p>

                                                        Similar to Word Match in that you can save up to 4 custom lists but this is not just a simple list of words.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        You will need to have a bit of a think about how you want to put these lists together as they contain Clues as well as the Answers.

                                                        The idea behind this application is to provide another angle to help with learning new or troublesome words.

                                                        Enter 6 Clues and their corresponding Answers into one of your custom lists and either play it yourself or hand it to a student, family member or friend to complete.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        You/They will have to read the Clue and by selecting sections of words below the Clues, peice together the Answer until all of the Clues have been Answered.
